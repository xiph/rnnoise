RNNoise is a noise suppression library based on a recurrent neural network

To compile, just type:
% ./configure
% make

Optionally:
% make install

While it is meant to be used as a library, a simple command-line tool is
provided as an example. It operates on RAW 16-bit (machine endian) mono
PCM files sampled at 48 kHz. It can be used as:

./examples/rnnoise_demo input.pcm output.pcm

The output is also a 16-bit raw PCM file.
